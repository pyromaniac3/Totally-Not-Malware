# Getting Started
1. Clone the Github directory: `git clone https://github.com/pyromaniac3/Totally-Not-Malware.git` 
2. Open Google Chrome
3. Click on the "Kebab Menu" (3 vertical dots) on the top right of the Google Chrome window (Underneath the "X" to close Google Chrome).
4. Hover over Extensions on the opened menu and click on Manage Extensions.
5. Click on Developer Mode on the top right, underneath the Kebab Menu that you clicked on earlier.
6. Click on Load unpacked on the top left.
7. Select the root directory of this Github Project. This should be named Totally-Not-Malware (unless you changed the Github project name when cloning).

# Testing
1. To test the extension, make sure that it is active in the Manage Extensions menu. 
2. Search something up in Google Search or go to this website https://github.com/pyromaniac3/Totally-Not-Malware. The default Chrome tab menu doesn't seem to properly load in a body for the script to attach to?
3. You should see a static reddish-pink square near the top left.
4. To load any changes you make to the extension, you must press the Reload button in the Manage Extensions menu next to the On/Off button for our extension.

## Testing with Live Server
1. If you have Live Server installed, simply start it up and go to your [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html). Ensure that the extension is active.

# Features
```
- Feed it to maintain it's hunger

- It occasionally will make a pop up screen to talk to you

- After a while of zero activity it will knock on the screen and zoom in to itself to get your attention
  - [if its permanently walking around your screen like the desktop goose] Eyes will track to your mouse position

- Messing with the webpage
  - Scroll down this page to see very disruptive effects: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/service-worker-events
```
# Code Structure
| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| index.html | A test environment that can be picked up by Live Server to test the tamagotchi in an empty environment. |
| tamagotchi.html | The window that pops up upon clicking on the extension button in the Chrome hotbar. |
| manifest.json | Handles importing all relevant files into the extension + what sites the extension can run on. REQUIRED by Chrome Extension API. |
| background.js | Used by the service-worker to enact events. Useful in messing with the entire page. |
| scripts/tamagotchi.js | The main driver for the tamagotchi. All business logic should go here (Eating, Petting, Sleeping, ...). |
| scripts/tamagotchi.css | The sample Github link used CSS spritesheets to animate their pet. We could do something similar or use some type of external library. |
| images/* | Where all images are stored. IMPORT THEM THROUGH "manifest.json". |
